I'm going to use this blog only to log random thoughts and will try to keep at it as often as I can. For this reason, it's going to be very quick writeups, not intended to be particularly shared. Obviously I won't mind anyone stumbling upon them since I'll upload the posts.

My website is an outlet for me to learn. It's where I'll post most of my experiments in trying to learn web development. In the same sense, this blog will be an outlet for me to write about the experience. I don't intend it as a way to bring traffic or experiment with marketing. Just a place to vent.

# No sharing, no tracking

So, I won't particularly share my posts. I might tweet them from time to time but I'm not going to actively try something "great" here.

For the same reason, I'm not going to track traffic to it. I was inspired by **a guy I need to find the name of**. His thought process was that if an article was getting traction, he'd know about it from social media anyway. Since my goal here isn't to bring people to the site, that's one more reason not to track anything.

# I'll strive to keep things simple and small

How many ideas have I killed before even starting them? Every time it seems that my cool ideas become projects that get out of control and freak me out even before I start doing anything. As soon as I start thinking about it not being perfect, I lose interest and move on to the other idea that I won't start either.

It's become a redundant process that I'm happy to get out of. Since I started classes on Codecademy, and then Treehouse, I've created a lot of small websites from scratch, not worring about their usefulness. I intend to keep making useless sites for a while. I'm having much fun doing so. For once, I started not thinking about crafting the perfect thing from the get go, I'm actually very happy pushing horrible stuff because I know some time from now I'll come back to these sites, laugh about how bad they are, and maybe even fix them into a v2 if I'm enclined.

# Minimal design, no buttons, just text

I already read tons of blogs that are aimed to drive traffic to their main site. It's part of my job.
