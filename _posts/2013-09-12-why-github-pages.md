What really got me started was the pretty convincing [Why I Don't Write for Medium](https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/c7cc156bc5d9) by Joe Wegner.
What truly resonated with me wasn’t really the IP problems stated (although these are probably valid points to avoid Medium). No, what made me want to try setting up my own blog on Github Pages is this:

1. **Learning Git**
2. **Learning code**. Improving on my basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge
3. **Managing my blog structure the way I want**
4. **Keeping control** of my site's experience. I don't want sponsored articles to be attached to mine. I want to have other pages.
5. **Keeping it free** gh-pages are free hosting.
6. **It sounded easy as hell** (It’s really not if you never used terminal before. But I figured it afterwards and the whole set up thing is pretty exciting anyway)

That’s how I opened Terminal with a purpose for the first time.
