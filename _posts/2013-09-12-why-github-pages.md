# On coding something else than HTML
## Quick intro: I don’t (usually) code
I have never coded something. To me, Ruby, Python, Node, C, C++, Pascal are just names. I read about them, I have some diffuse ideas of concepts about these languages but it’s just what I heard actual developers say. I never actually got my hands dirty playing with any of them.

That changed yesterday when I decided it was time to start a blog built with something else than a ready-made platform: First I had started with Tumblr and a free theme, then Wordpress for Nitrogram which I didn’t have any part in setting up, then Medium to resurrect my personal blogging abilities, for which I only had to sign up to a mailing list.

## Why github pages?

That is all to say I wanted to experience something more... advanced. Advanced *to me*, at least. What really got me started was the pretty convincing “Why I Why I Don’t Write for Medium” by @Joe_wegner, which garnered quite a bit of attention.
What truly resonated wasn’t really the IP problems stated (although these are probably valid points to avoid Medium, I don’t really care about what becomes of my writing so far, I’m no pro, and I’m not going to freak out if my content gets “stolen” (unlike that guy).
No, what made me want to try setting up my own blog on Github Pages is this:
1. **Learning Git** as this is what my coworkers use to code Nitrogram
2. **Learning to code** a little more. I have some basic HTML/CSS knowledge but I want to improve until I can consider myself dangerous
3. **Managing my blog structure the way I want**
4. **Creating a cooler “about me” page** AKA some kind of online resume AKA just a page with clean text over clean images in the background.
5. **Github Pages are free too**
6. **It sounded easy as hell** (It’s not but I figured it afterwards and the whole set up thing is pretty exciting anyway)

So there you have it. That’s how 3 days ago I opened Terminal with a purpose for the first time.

## Github Pages + Jekyll = Very easy for a developer, not so much for me
