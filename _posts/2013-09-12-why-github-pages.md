# Quick intro: I don’t (usually) code
I have never coded something. To me, Ruby, Python, Node, C, C++, Pascal are just names. I read about them, I have some blurred ideas of concepts about these languages but it’s just what I heard developers say. I never actually got my hands dirty playing with any of them.

That changed yesterday when I decided it was time to start a blog built with something else than a ready-made platform: First I had started with Tumblr and a free theme, then Wordpress for Nitrogram which I didn’t have any part in setting up, then Medium to resurrect my personal blogging abilities, for which I only had to sign up to a mailing list.

# Why github pages?

That is all to say I wanted to experience something more... advanced. Advanced *to me*, at least. What really got me started was the pretty convincing <a href="https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/c7cc156bc5d9" target="_blank">Why I Don't Write for Medium</a> by Joe Wegner.
What truly resonated with me wasn’t really the IP problems stated (although these are probably valid points to avoid Medium). No, what made me want to try setting up my own blog on Github Pages is this:

1. **Learning Git**
2. **Learning code**. Improving on my basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge
3. **Managing my blog structure the way I want**
4. **Keeping control** of my site's experience. I don't want sponsored articles to be attached to mine. I want to have other pages.
5. **Github Pages are free** so I don't need to pay for web hosting.
6. **It sounded easy as hell** (It’s really not if you never used terminal before. But I figured it afterwards and the whole set up thing is pretty exciting anyway)

That’s why I opened Terminal with a purpose for the first time.

# Github Pages + Jekyll = Very easy for a developer, not so much for me
